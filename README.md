# prism-hubot

Personal Telegram client for multi-channel publishing through Prism.

`prism-hubot` is the first concrete client product built on [`aiaiaiai-org/prism-bot`](https://github.com/aiaiaiai-org/prism-bot). It composes shared bot infrastructure instead of reimplementing Telegram transport, Prism Hub authorisation, lifecycle, or publishing behaviour.

## Current client

The client pins an immutable `aiaiaiai-prism-bot` commit and extends its public client-composition contract with the first Prism Hubot-specific conversational flow.

Available interactions:

- `/start` — onboard or resolve the Telegram user through Prism Hub;
- `/post` — start a two-message create-post flow;
- `зробити допис` — natural-text alias for `/post`;
- `/cancel` — cancel a pending conversational action;
- `/help` — show the Prism Hubot command surface;
- `/status` — read the caller-owned bot lifecycle state;
- `/stop` — persistently pause the caller-owned logical bot instance;
- `/resume` — resume a paused instance;
- `/channels` — list Hub-authorised publishing channels;
- `/publish text` — publish text through configured default channels;
- `/publish [channel-a,channel-b] text` — publish to explicit Hub channel IDs.

`/post` stores `awaiting_post_content`, prompts for text, and publishes the next ordinary message through the same shared publication handler used by `/publish`. Successful publication clears the state. A publishing failure leaves the state pending so the user can retry or use `/cancel`.

Provider credentials never enter this client. Telegram identity evidence, human authorisation, social-account access, channels, and publication permissions are resolved server-side by Prism Hub.

## Run locally

Ruby `4.0.6` is pinned in `.ruby-version`.

```bash
bundle install
cp .env.example .env
set -a && source .env && set +a
bundle exec rackup config.ru -s Puma -p 9292
```

Configure Telegram to send updates to `/telegram/webhook` using the same webhook secret as `PRISM_BOT_TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. `/healthz` is available for process liveness.

## Configuration

`.env.example` defines the runtime contract. Client defaults are explicit:

- instance: `prism-hubot`;
- locale: `uk-UA`;
- voice profile: `0x0sky.uk_SP`;
- dispatch policy: `require_all_valid`;
- interaction state TTL: `900` seconds;
- local interaction state directory: `var/interaction-state`.

`PRISM_HUBOT_INTERACTION_STATE_DIR` must point to persistent storage in a real deployment. The default relative directory is intended for local/single-node use. Do not place credentials in that directory; it contains only short-lived product interaction state.

Channel IDs remain empty until Hub exposes the concrete accounts/channels this client may publish to.

### Rename migration

The Ruby entry point is `lib/prism_hubot`, with the `PrismHubot` namespace. Client-owned environment variables use `PRISM_HUBOT_INTERACTION_STATE_DIR` and `PRISM_HUBOT_INTERACTION_STATE_TTL_SECONDS`; previous names have no compatibility aliases. Shared `PRISM_BOT_*` and `PRISM_HUB_*` variables keep their existing contract.

The example instance ID is `prism-hubot`. For an existing installation, retain its current `PRISM_BOT_INSTANCE_ID`, state directory, and TTL when adopting the new variable names: the instance ID participates in interaction-state and publication idempotency keys. Changing it intentionally starts a separate logical instance. This rename does not migrate stored state or change routing, publication, or lifecycle behaviour.
